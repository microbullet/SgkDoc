# Shotgun King Documentation
## Prerequisites 

### Things that you absolutely need to have before you begin modding Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate.  

- Basic knowledge file structures and how to navigate through menus 
- A text editor of some kind 
- An image editor, Windows should come pre-packaged with an image editor 
- Shotgun King version 1.24 or above 
- The directory in which your [Shotgun king] exe is stored 

### Some things that are preferred to have 
- Visual studio code 
- Access to version 1.244 
- Basic coding knowledge (Lua) 

### Some things to note before modding 
- The game is prone to crashing and not working properly 
- Never change the names of any of the files in the mod folder 
- Crash logs rarely provide you with help you can understand. if you encounter any problems that aren't explained in the documentation ask the PUNCAKE discord for help and most people will help, if you can’t find a reliable answer then contact me at “Spooky scary skeletone#6108” 

## How to install mods 
- Go into your SK directory and add a folder called mods  
- Get the [Base Mod.zip](https://github.com/microbullet/microbullet.github.io/files/8747070/Shotgun_King_Mod_Base.zip) file.
- Put the Base mod folder into the mods folder  
- If your file structure looks like “mods > base mod > files” then you are good to go 

## Smple modding 

### Texture modding 

Texture modding is the simplest type of modding as it requires no coding experience and works almost every time. Texture modding just requires that you edit the image with the texture you are looking for 

In the sample mod folder, there are 4 images that can be edited, they are 
- The intro where the king is holding his shotgun 
- The sprite sheet for all the in-game unit sprites 
- The card sprite sheet that contains all the cards and some spares 
- The Image with all the cutscenes on it 

When texture modding here’s what to watch out for 
- You cannot extend the images, or it breaks the textures (for now (we hope)) 
- The game is limited to 5 colors and any other color will appear transparent, the 5 colors are 
- ![colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73013941/168457764-4457721d-0dd4-4752-b0ea-7b7b53eed9f6.png)

### Text modding 

Text modding is changing what the text boxes say in the menus and in game, text modding can be used for either changing certain names of things in game or even adding in new languages to the game, it’s as simple as changing one of the id’s  

Format:  

Id of item::what is displayed 
E.g. 
play::begin  

Text modding can be done with a “<language here>.txt” file and including it in either the mod folder or in the dedicated “lang” folder  

## Complex modding  

Now we’re in the juicy section, this section will (try to) FULLY break down the script.lua file and exactly what everything means 

### Syntax used in the documentation 
```
<Int> 	 		      = a float 

<bool> 		        = either 1 or 0 meaning true or false 

<identifiers>  		= interchangeable for any of the identifiers 

<variable> 		    = one of the changeable values of the king such as firing arc 

<function>		    = <identifier>_<variable>=<int>, or does an action with a given input

## Card syntax 

`{[gid], [id], [n], [pwe], [effects]},` 

## Difficulties 

Difficulties are areas of play that determine how hard the game is.  

In game dev terms difficulties are just selectable options that alter non-specific variables for an entire run  

  
## Difficulty syntax
  
`{[number], [id], [effects]},`
  
## HERO_INIT (the base values) 
```
ammo_max=5, 

chamber_max=2, 

firepower=4, 

firerange=3, 

ammo_regen=1, 

spread=57, 

knockback=0, 

pierce=0, 

special="none", 

DEV=false -- enable to win floors instantly with space (testing purposes) 
```

### wand section
## Syntax
In the sript.lua the syntax for denoting a wand is

`wand={<int>, <input>},`
 
an `<input>` is not always required
 
## In game
In shotgun king there are 5 wands, these wands are unfortunately hardcoded to what the numbers inputted to them will alter however the numbers on 3 of the wands can be altered, these wands nad what the following input changes are:
 - Wrath, following `<input>` provides it's source of damage number, can be any defined variable above 1.
 - Downpour, the `<int>` following the 
 - Wings, the `<input>` determines how manys spaces you can move using the wand

## Srites
The sprites that the wands take in the top right are determined by their number (0 being the first and 4 being the last), the sprites can be found on the gfx.png sheet. 
 
## Modifications 
Trying to modify the wand number to outside the range of 0-4 the the sprite will show up but it will softlock the game.
 
## Common crash reasons 
- Not having correct syntax, this includes things like commas or equal signs. 
- Having a card mentioned in the exclusion area that doesn’t exist 
- Having the pwe value too high (like a billion high) 
- Not having a difficulty or card mentioned in the english.txt file
